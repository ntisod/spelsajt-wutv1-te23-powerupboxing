            What is PowerUPBoxing? 
        </h1>

        <p>
            PowerUPBoxing is a 3D, single player Adventure game where the player explores a big, open nature envoirment. With the ability to level up, steal powers from bosses, and go wherever the player wants, this game offers freedom like no other. PowerUPboxing is a boxinggame with a twist: Superpowers. 

        </p>
        <h2> What is the goal?</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of PowerUPBoxing is for the player to become the PowerUPBoxing champion. This means the player has to defeat all of the powerUPbosses in a fight. Each of these bosses offers a unique fight, a unique ability that the player can steal, and represents a different envoirment. For example, a boss with the ability to randomly throw stones at the player represents the envoirment, in this case a stony hill. There is a total of 10 bosses in PowerUPBoxing, each offering the player a different ability to steal. The player starts out with no extra abilities and only boxing mechanics - but can collect as many abilities as he/she wants. But remember: it takes alot of stamina! The player can, at any moment, explore any envoirment in the map and challenge any boss, but there is a guide for those who feel stuck! The map is faded at the start and becomes more and more visible as you explore.

        <h2> Enemies and envoirment</h2>

        <p> The PowerUPBoxing map offers plenty of different AI powered enemies. These appear randomly throughout the map, just like in The Legend of Zelda, and if the player stumbles accross these, there is potential to earn XP. The XP can then be used to upgrade abilities and mechanics and stamina through the progression system, allowing the player to take on progressively harder and harder bosses. BE AWARE: If you die, you will respawn at the last spawnpoint for that envoirment. </p>
